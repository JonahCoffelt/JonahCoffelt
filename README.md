# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonah
I am a software developer. I study at Texas A&M. I am interested in all things Python, graphics, algorithms, machine learning, web dev, and game dev. I am a lead developer of Basilisk Engine.
## Projects
### 🌐 [Basilisk Engine](https://basilisk-website.vercel.app/)

### 🕹️ [Minecraft: Python Edition](https://github.com/JonahCoffelt/MinecraftPythonEdition)
- The best Minecraft clone written in python you will find. Includes many of the base features of minecraft, including mining, crafting, caves, smelting, and lighting.
