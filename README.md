# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonah
I am a software developer. I study at Texas A&M. I am interested in all things Python, graphics, algorithms, machine learning, web dev, and game dev.
## Projects
### 🌐 Basilisk Engine
- A simple and lightweight 3D engine built using ModernGL. Supports advanced rendering, model loading, lighting, physics, mesh generation, particles, and UI. Still under development
### 📐 Pygame Level Editor
- An easy to use robust level editor designed to make quick yet intresting levels. Made in Pygame for Pygame. Supports tile loading, layering, saving/loading, rule tiles, and advanced workflow tools.
### 🕹️ Minecraft: Python Edition
- The best Minecraft clone written in python you will find. Includes many of the base features of minecraft, including mining, crafting, caves, smelting, and lighting. 
### 🤖 Neural Network
- My first dive into ML. This was a simple neural network built from scratch using numpy. It was trained to recognize handwritten numbers with >95% accuracy.
