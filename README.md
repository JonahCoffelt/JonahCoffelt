# Hi, I'm Jonah
I am a software developer. I study at Texas A&M. I am intrested in all things Python, graphics, algorithms, machine learning, web dev, and game dev.
## Projects
### 3D Python Engine
- A simple and lightweight 3D engine built using ModernGL. Supports advanced rendering, model loading, lighting, physics, mesh generation, particles, and UI.
### Pygame Level Editor
- An easy to use robust level editor designed to make quick yet intresting levels. Made in Pygame for Pygame. Supports tile loading, layering, saving/loading, rule tiles, and advanced workflow tools.
### As A Mere Means
- A small game made for the Pirate Software Game Jam. Built using Pygame and playable in browser. Displays the possibilities of 2D game built for Pygame, with fun combat and impressive VFX.
### Neural Network
- My first dive into ML. This was a simply neural network built from scratch using numpy. It was trained to recognize handwritten numbers with >95% accuracy.
